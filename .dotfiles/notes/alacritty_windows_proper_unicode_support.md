Many unicode symbols are not properly rendered by the standard Windows console host `conhost.exe`, leading to rendering bugs like described in [Alacritty issue #7239](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/7239). Alacritty is somehow dependent on ConPTY for rendering on Windows, and to get proper support for unicode symbols in Alacritty one has to compile Windows Terminal's fork of the console host called `OpenConsole.exe` and a file `conpty.dll` from the Windows Terminal source code. The two files must also be added to `PATH`. Alacritty will only use this alternative console host file if compiled from master (perhaps because it's a new feature in version 0.13?).
